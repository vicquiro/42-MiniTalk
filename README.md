# Project Information

## Requirements
 - This project centers around constructing a data exchange system using signals within a UNIX environment.
 - It is compulsory to generate and implements executables for both the server and client.
 - Allow the client to transmit a string, specified as a parameter, to the server identified by its process ID (PID).
 - The server should display the string when it has been completely received.
