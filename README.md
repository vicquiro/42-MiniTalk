## About
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

## Requirements
# Mandatory
Implement both server and client executables.
Allow the client to transmit a string, specified as a parameter, to the server identified by its process ID (PID). The server should then display the received string.
Use only SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals for communication.

# Additional Information
This project centers around constructing a data exchange system using signals within a UNIX environment.
It is compulsory to generate executables for both the server and client.
The client sends a string to the server, identified by its process ID.
